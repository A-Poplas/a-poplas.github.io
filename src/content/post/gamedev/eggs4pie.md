 At Stableboy Entertainment we presented ourselves at two events - GameGangShow and NMN (Na meji nevidnega). We wanted to showcase what we do, so we decided to build a (mini)game, that could be played by the attendees and allow them to compete among themselves.

 We came up with the minigame **Eggs for Pie**, where players help Bertie (the main character of our upcoming games) catch eggs for the pie. In the limited amount of time, players must catch as many eggs as possible, while avoiding unwanted items.

###### My roles in the project were:
- Project Management
- Game Design
- Development (coding)
- UI/UX Design

The majority of assets were produced by our talented artist Marko R., who also took the role of game design. 

The game was built for Windows and macOS operating systems, but you can test out the ported version to HTML5 below (the performance of the ported version is not yet the best). [You can also download and try it out as an executable file.](https://a-poplas.itch.io/eggs4pie)
